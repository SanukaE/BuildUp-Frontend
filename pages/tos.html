                <p>
                    Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not
                    owned or controlled by Build Up.

                <p>
                    Build Up has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices
                    of any third-party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Build Up shall not be
                    responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in
                    connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through

                <h2>Governing Law</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Australia, without
                    regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.
                    If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions
                    of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service,
                    and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.

                    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time.
                    If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
                    What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound
                    by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
